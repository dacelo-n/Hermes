# hermes
Hermes was a messenger of the gods, the patron saint of orators and poetry. Our Hermes sets to bring such words and power by producing all the possible variations of casings ( upper, lower case) and permutations of words and numbers entered, to generate a list of "passphrases/passwords" or any meaningful phrase that a user desires.
